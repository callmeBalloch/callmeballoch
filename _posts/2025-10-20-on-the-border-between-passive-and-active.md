Lying on the couch for five days, absorbing whatever content some recommendation algorithm decided for me.

At least now I understand how the weights of a neural network percive the world. What they feel doesn’t really matter, Like the erosion of a drop of whater that shapes by friction the bed of a river. A small delta, positive or negative, commanded by a function that maximizes (though we both know it’s really minimizing) whatever someone else wants from me:
- my preferences,
- my money, 
- my opinions,
- and worse, my time.

Aren't we just a proxy to someone else goal? 
All this rambling just to say one thing:

The worst kind of entertainment is the passive one, it’s not that different than violence (aka Supervised Learning).
- You are shaped by someone else’s will.
- Your goal becomes someone else’s targets.
- You forget what is worth for you.

Moral: Active > Passive.
